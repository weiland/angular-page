# Angular Page and Controller Communication
### share data with multiple Controllers 

i just tried to achieve a solution to find a simple way
that controller can exchange data and that one can use
different templates without changing everything.

the script is written in coffeescript
so the app.js is just a compiled file.

i use Angular.js 1.2.5
